    <h2>1. AI-Based Malware Detection</h2>
    <p>
      Developed a phishing URL detection system using machine learning techniques. 
      Trained a Random Forest classifier on a unique phishing dataset, achieving over 90% accuracy. 
      Features were extracted from URLs, and a Flask web app was built for real-time detection.
    </p>

    <h2>2. SHADELS (Smart Helmet Detection and Engine Locking System)</h2>
    <p>
      A Raspberry Pi-based hardware project developed as part of VIT's Engineering Clinics. 
      The system promotes road safety by detecting helmet usage and monitoring alcohol consumption. 
      If alcohol is detected, the engine is automatically disabled, preventing the rider from operating the vehicle under unsafe conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Wonder Wheels (Wadhwani Foundation)</h2>
    <p>
      A hypothetical electric mobility startup ideated under the Wadhwani Foundationâ€™s startup bootcamp. 
      Included business planning, sustainability analysis, and product design concepts.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Language Learning Web App (MERN Stack)</h2>
